# OpenWRT - Text User Interface
OpenWRT Text User Interface for my last project in Scripting for Security for my HNC in Cyber Security. 

We were tasked to create a basic text user interface for OpenWRT for a router prototype to make it easier for the "support staff" to work with it, as in the prompt they were having issues with CLI commands.

The full tasks were as follows:

1) Display the available interfaces on the router
2) Select an interface and display the IP address
3) Select an interface and display the MAC address
4) Display the uptime of the router
5) Display the disk usage and CPU utilisation of the router
6) Restart the networking service on the router
7) Restart the ssh service on the router
8) Enter a port number and run an nmap scan on this port
9) Return the value of the nmap scan
10)Display the different firewall zones
11)Display the config for each of the firewall zones
12)Reboot the router

This was all created within a VM and then exported as an OVA as the final project, making it as small as possible. 

Key takeaways - VIM isn't as scary as it looks. After a while of using it, it actually gets a lot better and it's really good for work flow. I was afraid to use it originally after using so much of NANO.
